# wikiracer-but-multiplayer

web app for competitive wikipedia racing (wikiracing or wikipedia speedruns)
I had previously made a web app like this in react but it lacked multiplayer functionality, thus this is "wikiracer-but-multiplayer"

if you want to run this yourself, remember to update the node modules, have a postgresql database called wikiracer (or you can rename it and change the config) with appropriate passowrd and username (see the mikro-orm config file)
also remember to run "watch" before runnning "dev" or "start"
